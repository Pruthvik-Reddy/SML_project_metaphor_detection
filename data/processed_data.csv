"http://www.healthfreedom.info/Cancer%20Essiac.htm The Truth About Essiac Rene Caisse and her Herbal Cancer Treatment , ESSIAC Authentic , Original Essiac Tea Formula Documentation On a fateful day in 1922 Canadian nurse Rene Caisse happened to notice some scar tissue on the breast of an elderly English woman . The woman said that doctors had diagnosed her with breast cancer years before . However , the woman did n't want to risk surgery nor did she have the money for it . The English woman had met an old Indian medicine man in the 1890s who told her that he could cure her cancer with an herbal tea . The woman took the medicine man 's advice , and consequently she was still alive nearly thirty years later to pass on this herbal remedy to Nurse Caisse . About a year later , Rene Caisse was walking beside a retired doctor who pointed to a common weed and stated : `` Nurse Caisse , if people would use this weed there would be little cancer in the world . '' Rene later stated : `` He told me the name of the plant . It was one of the herbs my patient named as an ingredient of the Indian medicine man 's tea ! '' -LSB- I Was Canada 's Cancer Nurse -RSB- The `` weed '' was sheep sorrel . In a 1974 letter to Dr. Chester Stock Rene Caisse stated : `` Who in the world would ever think to find a solution to cancer in a common meadow ? '' -LSB- THE ESSENCE OF ESSIAC , p. 127 -RSB- In 1924 she decided to test the tea on her aunt who had cancer of the stomach and was given about six months to live . Her aunt lived for another 21 years , cancer free . Rene Caisse -LRB- pronounced `` Reen Case '' -RRB- later gave the tea to her 72-year old mother who was diagnosed with inoperable cancer of the liver , with only days to live . Her mother recovered and lived without cancer for another 18 years . In the ensuing years Nurse Caisse refined and perfected the original `` medicine man 's '' formula . She tested various herbal combinations on laboratory mice and on human cancer patients . She eventually reduced the tea to four herbs : burdock root , sheep sorrel , slippery elm and turkey rhubarb . She called the formula Essiac , which is her surname spelled backwards . -LSB- Read `` I Was Canada 's Cancer Nurse '' for more details . -RSB- Rene Caisse devoted over fifty years of her life to treating hundreds of cancer patients with Essiac . So effective were her treatments that in 1938 her supporters gathered 55,000 signatures for a petition , amongst other petitions , to allow Rene Caisse to continue treating cancer patients . A bill was introduced in the Ontario legislature to -LRB- allegedly -RRB- `` authorise Rene Caisse to practice medicine in the Province of Ontario in the treatment of cancer and conditions therein '' . Due to the machinations of the medical establishment , the bill failed to pass by just three votes . However , Rene Caisse made her views known regarding this bill which would set up the `` Royal Cancer Commission '' to investigate all possible cancer cures . She told the press : `` The people of Ontario will be paying a group of men to develop something that was developed and discovered 15 years ago . I have developed and proven a cure right here in Bracebridge , and I am running a clinic where hundreds of cancer sufferers are being treated and helped . Why then should I be asked to give my formula over to a group of doctors who never did anything to earn it ? '' -LSB- CALLING OF AN ANGEL , p. 59 .",1,light,3442

"http://society.guardian.co.uk/cancer/story/0,,1397219,00.html Finding out that she had breast cancer was a terrifying bombshell , of course , but at least Melanie McFadyean encountered a few new truths . Blondes do have more fun , graveyard humour helps but funeral manners from the well-meaning are a pain , and whatever you do , do n't believe the statistics Saturday January 22 , 2005 The Guardian I thought it would n't be me . I even ignored the reminder to get a mammogram . Many people I knew had had breast cancer , so I mistakenly imagined that the law of averages was on my side . I was foolishly confident that their collective misfortune somehow protected me . My best friend at school has had it . Of four close women friends of 25 years , two of us have had it . Of four of us sharing a flat at university in the 1970s , one has died from it and I have had it . Of four of us sat together at the Guardian 15 years ago , two of us have had it -LRB- and a third has died of lung cancer -RRB- . Of four of us who shared childminders , three of us have had it . When I tried using it to get out of a parking fine , the woman on the end of the phone would n't play ball - she had just come through it . One night last March , I went to sleep wondering how I was going to fit in a million things the next day , including going to a party for the colleague who 'd had breast cancer and was giving up work . I woke at 3.30 am with my finger on a lump , as though someone had crept in and arranged my hand as I slept . I was lucky . I caught it early . In the aftermath of diagnosis , I found myself on edges and in abysses I had never been to before . But as terrible as it was , it was never boring . It became a project , a journey , a new way of understanding myself , others and the world around me . There are things I would never have known or experienced if I had not had breast cancer . 1 Breast cancer does not , I learned , carry an automatic death sentence . When I was told I had it , I wept at the thought of leaving my son , my partner , my parents , my family , my friends . Thoughts ran on : I did n't know how to do anything but be alive , how would I do being dead ? You ca n't be dead . Dead is not being .
